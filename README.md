# Introduction

This is a photo app that allows users to create profiles, store photos, and share collages. It offers two main features:

* **"Collages without Editor"**: Creates collages from multiple photos while preserving their original properties. The appâ€™s logic automatically calculates the best positions for photos based on their dimensions to maintain their integrity when generating the final collage.

* **"Face Similarity"**: This feature lets you compare your face with anyone else's with just one click. The algorithm calculates similarity in percentage by comparing key facial features. By default, it compares your face to Sid Vicious, just to see if youâ€™re a â€˜realâ€™ punk! ðŸ˜„
